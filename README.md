CellularAutomata3D
==================

This is a Cellular Automata in 3D mode.

You can run it as a Java Application, which is recommended.

Requirement
===========

You need to install java3d firstly, and include it in the lib.

The recommended hardware: Memory: 4G(you need to enable java memory with '-Xmx2048m -Xms2048m').

###### How to run

For a server you can run ``` com.cellular3d.CellularAutomata3DServer ``` to start a server computation
without a desktop.

For a client you can run ``` com.cellular3d.CellularAutomata3DClient ``` to start a client with a window.
In these client you are able to connect to the computation server, using the remote computation kernel. 
You just need press "switch kernel" and "connect" MenuItems to connect. Of course, you can also use these 
to run a local computation kernel.

The method to start a computation is the same, which you can read besides the main Applet.

Feature
=======

Now you can see a cube include many dots.
